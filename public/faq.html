          <li>
            Are Andreas and Daniel real people, or are they just AI overlords in
            disguise?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We assure you, we're as real as your morning coffee spill. Andreas
              might have a few too many keyboard shortcuts memorized, though.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How many cups of coffee does Daniel consume daily to maintain his
            creative genius?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Let's just say, if caffeine were a currency, Daniel would be a
              billionaire. We're pretty sure he brews ideas along with his
              coffee.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Do you really add cat memes to your designs, or is that just a myth?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Confirmed. Our designs are 87% more purrfect when sprinkled with
              just the right amount of cat humor. It's the secret ingredient to
              happy websites.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What happens if Andreas and Daniel disagree on a design or coding
            decision?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We settle it the old-fashioned way: rock-paper-scissors, best of
              three. So far, scissors are leading, but Andreas is practicing his
              rock strategy.

          <li>Can I hire Andreas and Daniel to debug my life problems?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              While we're flattered by your trust in our debugging skills, we
              specialize in web solutions. But if your life problem is a buggy
              website, we've got you covered.

          <li>How do I pronounce 'Andreas' and 'Daniel'?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's pronounced "An-drey-as" and "Dan-yell". But feel free to add
              a dramatic flair. We won't judge if you go with "And-re-uh-s" or
              "Dan-yell-uh".
