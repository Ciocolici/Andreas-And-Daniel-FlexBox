# Andreas & Daniel
An updated version to a small [project](https://github.com/Ciocolici/Andreas-And-Daniel) created in my Web Development internship by Terrera AG / NBGTech, using only HTML and CSS.

This "new version" is a "remake" of the website, this time using FlexBox. The Pages "About" and "Blog" have been remade by [Andreas](https://github.com/ALV1923), my internship collegue, the "Home", "Contact" and "FAQ" pages have been remade by me. Other than the layout changes, I have also done some changes to other stuff like the Navbar and the Contact Formular.

*You can access the website [here](https://ciocolici.github.io/Andreas-And-Daniel-FlexBox/).*
