# Andreas & Daniel: FlexBox

This is an updated, responsive remake of the small [Andreas & Daniel](https://github.com/Ciocolici/Andreas-And-Daniel) website project I created during my Web Development internship at Terrera AG. The remake uses Flexbox and Media Queries to provide a better layout and mobile-friendly experience.

 - The About and Blog pages were remade by my internship colleague [ALV1923](https://github.com/ALV1923).

 - The Home, Contact, and FAQ pages were remade by me.

Besides layout improvements, I also enhanced the navigation bar and contact form functionality.
